# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of a junior software tester

## About me

I am an organized, responsible and thorough person. I pay attention to the smallest details. I also have highly developed analytical skills due to my previous position.

I graduated from full-time studies at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology with a master's degree in mechanics. I was responsible for the quality of technical documentation based on compliance with international and internal standards for the automotive industry.

Recently, I started to be interested in software testing. I would like to deepen this knowledge and develop my technical skills. I am intensively learning techniques and tools for testing. I participate in online courses, webinars, read blogs, deepen my knowledge in private groups on social networks and test web applications dedicated to educational purposes. 

I would love to take my first steps as a junior tester and gain my first commercial experience. In future I'm oriented for further development as Automation Tester.
